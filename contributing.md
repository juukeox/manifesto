#Impose a blocking limit

Having the ability to block votes makes sense for certain situations. However, this tool will end up being too detrimental to the potential for the evolution of ideas if people can use it as often as they wish. Some sort of limit should be imposed, such as only one block allowed for every 10 votes made, or a limit of 3 per year, for example. A consensus can be reached afterwards on what form this limit should take, but first it should be agreed that one is necessary and such an unbridled power should not be entrusted to an individual's responsibility.
